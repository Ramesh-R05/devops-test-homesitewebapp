                        "A quality carpet takes a floor from drab to fab. Itâ€™s transformative because it softens the look of a room and absorbs noise, creating a cosy, nurturing environment. \n\nTo choose the best carpet for your home, you'll want to think through these things:\n\n**1. Consider the way you live**\nIf you have a young family and pets then look for a hardwearing carpet in a forgiving colour, such as a textured loop pile or a quality hard-twist cut. If youâ€™re a couple looking for a touch of luxury, you might opt for a plush pile in a flat colour. If youâ€™re an entertainer, a combination cut and loop pile in mid-to-dark tones or a stippled cut pile would suit. \n\n**2. Think about plush piles**\nCut piles include plush piles, which are super soft and look like velvet. If you want that squishy, luxurious feeling then dense, plush-pile carpets are lovely, but bear in mind they show footprints. \n\n**3. Take a look at loop piles** \nLoop piles are exactly that; the yarn is formed into loops. There are lots of variations: some have a formal, linear look, some have a ribbed pattern, giving them a sisal look. Random loop piles give the carpet a textured, casual look.\n\n**4. Mix it up**\nCombination cut and loop pile carpets, where the contrasting textures create a light and dark pattern are less likely to show footprints and have a lovely texture underfoot.\n\n**5. Understand how carpet colour works**\nDarker colours help make a room appear cosier. Lighter colours make a room appear larger. A popular option is to choose a carpet that combines two colours in a subtle, neutral blend. Itâ€™s more forgiving when it comes to stains. \n\n**6. Anticipate a fade**\nCarpet will appear lighter once installed and will fade over time, so choose one that is a shade or two deeper than you planned. \n\n**7. Consider your preferred fibre type**\nCarpets are available in 100-per-cent wool, wool-nylon mixes and myriad synthetic fibres. Wool is cool in summer and warm in winter â€“ and itâ€™s not necessarily more expensive. Of the synthetic fibres, solution-dyed nylon is the pick. Itâ€™s generally fade resistant and soft to touch.\n\n**8. Lie on it**\nIf people in your family like to lounge on the floor, make sure you buy a heavy weight, dense carpet. The heavier a carpet sample, the more yarn it's likely to have.\n\n**9. Check the ratings**\nThere is a ratings system for Australian carpets. Look for a carpet that has an â€˜extra heavy duty gradeâ€™ residential rating. And if youâ€™re carpeting stairs, make sure it has a stairs rating."

                        'Whether you forked out for silverware to make your grandma proud or you have gone for the utilitarian everyday set, it pays to look after your cutlery set. \n\nHere are some simple rules that will help you keep them in top condition:\n\n**1. Give them room!**\nStainless steel is dishwasher-safe, but allow plenty of space between items to avoid movement during the cycle and prevent scratches. \n\n**2. Get them dry ASAP**\nWatch your washing habits to make your stainless steel cutlery last. Prolonged storage in a damp dishwasher can cause rust, so remove and hand-dry aÂ¬fter the cycle is finished. The same goes for handwashing â€“ make sure you dry your cutlery with a tea towel rather than leave it to air-dry.\n\n**3. Make friends with polish and white vinegar**\nA mild abrasive or metal polish will remove marks and stains from stainless steel. For water stains, rub in alcohol or salad oil. To maintain the shine, use a sponge with white vinegar.\n\n**4. Give your silver the silver treatment**\nSilver-plated and sterling-silver cutlery is best washed and dried by hand. It should be stored in a cutlery box or roll to reduce oxidisation, which causes silver to tarnish. If tarnish appears, remove with a quality silver cleaner.\n\n**5. Storage matters**\nStore stainless-steel cutlery in its original canteen to prevent pieces rubbing together. Storing in a kitchen drawer is fine but will reduce the lifespan.'

                        'Thereâ€™s a good reason for the popularity of timber floors: they look great. Theyâ€™re also long-lasting, if you look after them.\n\nThe reality is that regardless of its density, hardness or coating, timber floors will mark and scratch.\n\nThey can be resurfaced and re-coated as required. But before you get to that stage there are some things you can do to look after them from day dot and beyond.'

                        'Pre-finished timber floors can be used immediately, but bring your furniture in carefully. â€œIf a floor is being coated on-site, wait 48 hours for it to harden before you use it,â€ says Sue Smith, sales consultant at [Queensland Timber Flooring](http://www.queenslandtimberflooring.com/|target="_blank")\n\nShe also suggests that all furniture placed on your new floor should have protective pads underneath. And go easy when you install appliances, advises Kendall Waller, national product manager for [Premium Floors](http://www.premiumfloors.com.au/|target="_blank").\n\nEach appliance should be moved across one sheet of MDF or masonite and straight onto a second one, â€˜leapfroggingâ€™ the sheets as you move the appliance to the right position.\n\nâ€œThis way, the appliance is never in contact with the floor, nor is anything dragged along the floor,â€ says Waller. â€œIf I had a dollar for every new floor Iâ€™ve seen damaged from appliance moves, Iâ€™d be rich!â€'

                        'The type of coating on your timber boards will determine what sort of maintenance is required. Oil-based coatings will scratch more readily than others, but they can easily be patch-coated as required.\n\nâ€œYou might need to touch things up between one and three times a year, depending on the pattern of use,â€ says Waller. Water and solvent-based polyurethanes are more durable but canâ€™t be patch-coated.\n\nâ€œTheyâ€™ll leave application marks and you may see gloss variations,â€ Waller explains. â€œSo the whole floor needs to be re-coated, generally every three to seven years.â€'

Itâ€™s now an airy four-bedroom family home with ensuites and private decks.\n\nFor those who are in love with the style of the home, you can experience it for yourself. The house is part of a property that includes Kimberly and Stephenâ€™s boutique hotel [The Atlantic Byron Bay](http://atlanticbyronbay.com.au/|target="_blank").\n\nThe home and hotel emanate a laidback holiday vibe inspired by Hawaii, the Bahamas, the Hamptons and, of course, Byron Bay. A Mini Moke beach buggy, a sentimental purchase, parked in the carport ups the holiday feel. â€œIt reminds me of my childhood in Noosa,â€ Kimberly says. â€œIâ€™d always wanted one as the family â€˜surf carâ€™ so when my dad rang to say a friend was selling one of his, I jumped at it.â€'

She and the kids made the colourful bunting that hangs across the carport entrance from ripped, taped and spray-painted calico for a school art show. A designer-like paper pendant over the dining table was also a school project. â€œI had collected a bunch of old books and Iâ€™d guillotine the pages into squares and leave them in my sonâ€™s classroom,â€ Kimberly says. â€œThe kids would fold them in their quiet time. We then glue-gunned them to seven different-sized paper lanterns and entered them in the Byron Bay Writers Festival Sculpture Show where they won the Peopleâ€™s Choice award. It was a very beautiful experience.â€\n\nThe home is a short walk to town but could be a thousand miles away. In a lush garden, its relaxed vibe and space to create makes every day a holiday for the family â€“ at home.'
