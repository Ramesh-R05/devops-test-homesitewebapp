                        "A quality carpet takes a floor from drab to fab. It's transformative because it softens the look of a room and absorbs noise, creating a cosy, nurturing environment. \n\nTo choose the best carpet for your home, you'll want to think through these things:\n\n**1. Consider the way you live**\nIf you have a young family and pets then look for a hardwearing carpet in a forgiving colour, such as a textured loop pile or a quality hard-twist cut. If you're a couple looking for a touch of luxury, you might opt for a plush pile in a flat colour. If you're an entertainer, a combination cut and loop pile in mid-to-dark tones or a stippled cut pile would suit. \n\n**2. Think about plush piles**\nCut piles include plush piles, which are super soft and look like velvet. If you want that squishy, luxurious feeling then dense, plush-pile carpets are lovely, but bear in mind they show footprints. \n\n**3. Take a look at loop piles** \nLoop piles are exactly that; the yarn is formed into loops. There are lots of variations: some have a formal, linear look, some have a ribbed pattern, giving them a sisal look. Random loop piles give the carpet a textured, casual look.\n\n**4. Mix it up**\nCombination cut and loop pile carpets, where the contrasting textures create a light and dark pattern are less likely to show footprints and have a lovely texture underfoot.\n\n**5. Understand how carpet colour works**\nDarker colours help make a room appear cosier. Lighter colours make a room appear larger. A popular option is to choose a carpet that combines two colours in a subtle, neutral blend. It's more forgiving when it comes to stains. \n\n**6. Anticipate a fade**\nCarpet will appear lighter once installed and will fade over time, so choose one that is a shade or two deeper than you planned. \n\n**7. Consider your preferred fibre type**\nCarpets are available in 100-per-cent wool, wool-nylon mixes and myriad synthetic fibres. Wool is cool in summer and warm in winter â€“ and it's not necessarily more expensive. Of the synthetic fibres, solution-dyed nylon is the pick. It's generally fade resistant and soft to touch.\n\n**8. Lie on it**\nIf people in your family like to lounge on the floor, make sure you buy a heavy weight, dense carpet. The heavier a carpet sample, the more yarn it's likely to have.\n\n**9. Check the ratings**\nThere is a ratings system for Australian carpets. Look for a carpet that has an â€˜extra heavy duty grade' residential rating. And if you're carpeting stairs, make sure it has a stairs rating."

                        'Whether you forked out for silverware to make your grandma proud or you have gone for the utilitarian everyday set, it pays to look after your cutlery set. \n\nHere are some simple rules that will help you keep them in top condition:\n\n**1. Give them room!**\nStainless steel is dishwasher-safe, but allow plenty of space between items to avoid movement during the cycle and prevent scratches. \n\n**2. Get them dry ASAP**\nWatch your washing habits to make your stainless steel cutlery last. Prolonged storage in a damp dishwasher can cause rust, so remove and hand-dry aÂ¬fter the cycle is finished. The same goes for handwashing â€“ make sure you dry your cutlery with a tea towel rather than leave it to air-dry.\n\n**3. Make friends with polish and white vinegar**\nA mild abrasive or metal polish will remove marks and stains from stainless steel. For water stains, rub in alcohol or salad oil. To maintain the shine, use a sponge with white vinegar.\n\n**4. Give your silver the silver treatment**\nSilver-plated and sterling-silver cutlery is best washed and dried by hand. It should be stored in a cutlery box or roll to reduce oxidisation, which causes silver to tarnish. If tarnish appears, remove with a quality silver cleaner.\n\n**5. Storage matters**\nStore stainless-steel cutlery in its original canteen to prevent pieces rubbing together. Storing in a kitchen drawer is fine but will reduce the lifespan.'

And go easy when you install appliances, advises Kendall Waller, national product manager for [Premium Floors](http://www.premiumfloors.com.au/|target="_blank").\n\nEach appliance should be moved across one sheet of MDF or masonite and straight onto a second one, â€˜leapfrogging\' the sheets as you move the appliance to the right position.\n\nâ€œThis way, the appliance is never in contact with the floor, nor is anything dragged along the floor,â€ says Waller. â€œIf I had a dollar for every new floor I\'ve seen damaged from appliance moves, I\'d be rich!â€'

                        "The type of coating on your timber boards will determine what sort of maintenance is required. Oil-based coatings will scratch more readily than others, but they can easily be patch-coated as required.\n\nâ€œYou might need to touch things up between one and three times a year, depending on the pattern of use,â€ says Waller. Water and solvent-based polyurethanes are more durable but can't be patch-coated.\n\nâ€œThey'll leave application marks and you may see gloss variations,â€ Waller explains. â€œSo the whole floor needs to be re-coated, generally every three to seven years.â€"

Gloss-finished floors may need to be towel-dried afterwards to avoid water marks.\n\nSpecialist timber cleaning products are available: Queensland Timber Flooring recommends [Feast Watson](http://www.feastwatson.com.au/|target="_blank") Floorclean to clients.'

                        "Willawong, at Merricks North on Victoria's picturesque Mornington Peninsula, is a garden that reveals itself slowly with graceful vistas and surprising turns. The first of these moments is the welcoming party â€“ a flock of geese occupying the paddock beside the tree-lined driveway.\n\nGeese can be territorial, often protecting properties like guard dogs, but these birds barely look up when a newcomer arrives. \n\nOwner Jenny Lansell says a gaggle of these rather regal-looking birds was already in residence when she and her husband Cyril bought the property more than 20 years ago. As well as the geese, there were two timber cottages on the property; one was restored, the other replaced."

Jenny loves mass planting and a swathe of agapanthus edges the driveway, filling the garden with blue flowers in summer.\n\nâ€œThe site is sloping and exposed, so our priority was to create level areas and shelter,â€ says Jenny. Dry-stone terraces were built to the south of the new house, while to the north lawn terraces create a platform for enjoying the country views.\n\nHedges are another signature design element: a thick border of willow-leaved hakea (*Hakea salicifolia*) is planted along the boundary for shelter, while clipped hedges of fragrant Mexican orange blossom (*Choisya ternate*) enclose four sides of the house. There are also low hedges of coastal rosemary (*Westringia fruticosa*) â€˜Smokey\'.'

The blooms are followed in late summer by attractive red, yellow and orange â€˜crabs'.\n\nNext to the house is the birch lawn, inspired by the random planting theory promoted by the late noted Australian garden designer, Edna Walling. \n\nâ€œI read that Edna Walling tossed a bucket of potatoes out across the lawn to get a random planting pattern so we did that here,â€ says Jenny. â€œWe tossed the potatoes and planted a birch where each potato landed. It worked well.â€"

This area is enclosed by self-sufficient Australian natives and drought-hardy succulents, which provide year-round colour. \n\nIn a sheltered sunny spot not far from the kitchen is a Mediterranean-style garden with a formal arrangement of raised beds, overflowing with vegies and herbs. And this is not the only productive area of the garden: a short walk from the house there is an orchard, and beyond that a garden devoted to citrus and still more vegetable gardens, with a large area for pumpkins and raspberries. \n\nMartin is still helping Jenny shape her garden paradise, assisted these days by his son Shannon, who was three when his father started working at Willawong. â€œMartin's skill and vision have helped me develop this garden,â€ says Jenny. â€œIt's been a joint venture all the way.â€"

But the house â€“ once home to eminent Victorian educator, Sir James Darling â€“ got under their skin and the notion of restoring it to its former glory grew more appealing. \n\nâ€œWe were torn,â€ says Nicholas, an architect. â€œIn the end, we just couldn't bring ourselves to demolish it.â€ And so began the process of designing and building a structure that was sympathetic to the home's DNA yet true to the couple's vision. \n\nToday, the Murrays are relishing life in a four-bedroom home spread over two levels (plus basement wine cellar and car parking) that transitions the centuries beautifully. In restoring the original section of the house, Nicholas and Fiona re-used as many of the existing elements and materials as possible, including bricks, windows, fire surrounds, even curtains, which now hang in the formal living room. â€œWe wanted a memento of the previous owners. Call us sentimental!â€ says Fiona, with a laugh."

It's a quirky and very personal point of difference in a house that pushes so many design boundaries. \n\nâ€œWe found the wallpaper in the kitchen out the back of a paint shop in Port Melbourne â€“ it even smelled like the '70s,â€ says Fiona. â€œWe love it. It gives the kitchen real presence.â€ \n\nThere were many challenges during construction, but Fiona says she cherishes the time spent researching the history of the old girl. The beautiful Gothic Revival architecture â€“ now restored to its former glory â€“ gives barely a hint of the striking, ultra-modern home the Murrays have created around it. It's a family home for the ages."

                        "Droubalgie is an elegant country estate perched on the banks of the Lachlan River in western NSW. It's the birthplace and part-time residence of renowned industrial designer Charles Wilson and his sister Virginia, an art consultant with a notable clientele. \n\nThe foundations of the homestead were laid in 1862 by Sir Frederick William Pottinger, an aristocratic constable who successfully arrested a notorious local bushranger named Ben Hall. \n\nThe east wing, a simple construction of five rooms, was built first and overlooks what is now a neatly manicured lawn (great for croquet, a game at which Charles excels). \n\nThe rest followed in increments until the 1950s when Jane, a decorator from New Zealand, fell in love with Alan Wilson of NSW and decided to up sticks and move in."

The main guestroom â€“ and most contested room â€“ is layered with elaborate printed wallpaper and fabric. A bookshelf in the living room bursts with old volumes on floristry (Jane\'s passion) and vintage cars (most definitely Alan\'s). \n\nThe Garden Room, a gracious screened annex appended in the 1950s, is where Charles does much of his design work. Commissions for clients like [Herman Miller](http://www.hermanmiller.com/|target="_blank"), [Woodmark](http://woodmark.com.au/|target="_blank"), and [King Living](http://www.kingliving.com.au/|target="_blank") are placed around the house. \n\nIn the living room, Charles\' high-back Seymour swivels in a cut windowpane velour, a chunky matching ottoman at its feet. In the Bird Room, a Seymour low-back steel chair is upholstered in blue â€“ a serene resting point amid the cacophony of print.'

There's even a hacksaw hanging in the kitchen for unwieldy cuts of meat. \n\nAt night, the curtains close with a gravitas that comes with thick linen lining and the carpets are soft underfoot. Encircled by an English-style garden, with endless paddocks beyond, and overlooked by what Charles calls â€˜welcome palms', it's an oasis of calm on a real working farm. \n\nCharles is clearly at ease here; when not wrangling with the original Aga to whip up memorable meals, he can be found outside, tending his plants."

He's as likely to wax lyrical about the proportions of French doors or the sash window panes as he is to debate the merits of Bauhaus. \n\nIt's intriguing to see his contemporary designs worked into this gracious heritage home. His latest design, the white onyx Atomic vase, adorns various rooms, and his Serif stool (an occasional seat that appears to be modelled on machinery debris) brings a modern industrial allure to the 19th-century setting. \n\nWhen back in Sydney, Charles lives in a stylish Art Deco apartment with a picture-postcard view of the harbour. Beautiful as it is, Droubalgie is where he's most at home."

The major structural work was carried out in 2006 with the completion of the interior fit-out plus the addition of an outdoor room finished in 2012. \n\nâ€œWe kept elements of the old house; we liked the fact there was a big carport alongside a courtyard garden at the entrance. But, as it was open to the sky, we covered it with hardwood battens topped with fibreglass roofing for weather protection.â€  \n\nThe previous kitchen was transformed into a welcoming entrance foyer with a new staircase tucked to one side. Above, a sky-lit double space void filters morning light deep into the newly-constructed downstairs kitchen/dining/living rooms.'

                        "The abode's 1972 birth-date combined with the couple's admiration for Californian mid-century architecture informed the shading solution for the west-facing rear exterior. A white screen with adjustable aluminium blades protecting the full faÃ§ade is a visor-like piece de resistance. In contrast, the laid-back, new outdoor room built from spotted gum softens the home's glass and steel-frame geometric lines. \n\nThroughout all the interiors, curated collections of flotsam and jetsam happily co-exist alongside pieces such as wall-mounted Andy Warhol skateboard decks, inherited vintage maps, ceramics, sculptures, indigenous artefacts and street art. Adding tactile interest is a palette of natural materials such as the cross-cut travertine that features around the fireplace.\n\nWhile it may be non-conformist, this home with its easy-breezy coastal vibe perfectly captures the family's heartbeat. â€œWe've filled it with items that we love and we use â€“ such as the surfboards and skateboards â€“ and there's enough space to have these out on display,â€ Patrick says."

By using modern lines, natural materials and fresh, contemporary colours, they\'ve achieved their goal: a fuss-free home that performs perfectly for their young family.\n\n\nThe innovative design was driven by nostalgia and shaped by the constraints of the sloping, 410m2 block in a beachside Perth suburb. â€œI spent my childhood holidays in an old-style stilt house, which I loved,â€ says Gerard. â€œWe mentioned this to our architects [Klopper & Davis Architects](http://www.kada.com.au/|target="_blank") and they took the stilt concept to another level completely.â€'

Only 70m2 of the house touches the ground, leaving plenty of free space on the property.\n\n\nFrom the outset the concept wowed the couple and captured the imagination of their sons Harry and Sam, who followed each step of construction with excitement and dubbed the result â€œour floating houseâ€.\n\n\nThe exterior features reclaimed bricks from the site's original house. A long driveway ends at a yellow front door that opens to the lower ground floor. This space contains just two rooms: a study and a large, multi-functional space."

They noticed bricks featured heavily and incorporated bricks from the site's original house in the exterior. â€œIt gives the house a grounded sort of feeling,â€ says Gerard.\n\n**2. Eco-friendly:** â€œWe have louvres at the front and back of the house, and at the top and bottom, so we have natural air movement that cools the house in summer,â€ says Kristen. â€œAnd, with the big windows on the northern side, our interior is naturally heated in winter.â€\n\n**3. Splish splash:**  The main bathroom used by Harry and Sam is completely waterproof. â€œIt is like a European-style wet room, which is brilliant!â€ says Gerard. â€œThe kids can splash and you don't have to worry.â€\n\n**4. Hole-proof:** The couple specified a hanging rail for displaying art in the living room. â€œWe had seen it somewhere and we thought it was a better idea than holes in the wall,â€ says Gerard.\n\n**5. Wash off:** The original plan was to have an outdoor shower in the backyard, but they decided to lay grass for the kids instead. â€œIt made sense to us to have the outdoor shower near the entrance for rinsing off after we've been to the beach,â€ says Gerard."

This comes as little surprise to Jefferies. â€œThe garage is often the largest space you have, so it makes practical sense to use it to its full potential,â€ he says.'

Or, for a fraction of the cost, you can do it yourself by choosing from the vast range of garage storage products available from companies such as Howards Storage World. \n\nIf space is tight, consider ceiling-mounted storage (check out [Lifespace](http://www.lifespace.com.au/|target="_blank")) or even an over-car cabinet that occupies the space above a car bonnet (available from [The Box Thing](http://www.theboxthing.com.au/|target="_blank")). \n\nSturdy, plastic-lidded boxes are ideal for storing smaller bits; stacked vertically, they don\'t swallow up floor space. Also look for hidden storage opportunities, such as the backs of doors, where you can hang baskets. â€œWith proper organisation and the right storage tools you can reveal usable space you never even knew you had,â€ says Player.'

                        "## Garage overhaul\nCathy Player of Howards Storage World shares her top tips for organising your garage:\n* Start by decluttering. Pull everything out and divide into three piles: everyday, occasional and deep archive. Throw out what you don't need. Â¬\n* Store frequently used items at hand height, occasionally used ones at shoulder height or above, and heavy items down low. Â¬\n* Keep the lawnmower and bikes near the garage door so they don't track in dirt. \n* Drawers are great for small, similar items. You can use the cabinet top as a work surface.\n* Create a â€˜clutter trap' near the door to the house to prevent mess entering â€“ think coat hooks, boot storage, and generous baskets."
