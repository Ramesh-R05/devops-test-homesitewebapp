Decorating with mostly black, mostly white, or a combination of both gives you ultimate freedom. The look can be classic, eclectic, punk, country, beachy, and just about anything in between.\nHIGHLIGHT THE OTHER COLOURS BODY HEADING EOM\nBlack and white together are perfect for highlighting other colours. For example, black is considered to be the “absence of colour”, so it makes colours appear more vivid and luminous in comparison. Similarly, white makes colours feel saturated and “pop”.'
