                        "Renovating a bathroom essentially involves tackling an avalanche of styling decisions, and with an overwhelming array of tile and fixture choices available, these decisions can sometimes be near-impossible to make. One way to overcome bathroom decision-making fatigue is to throw everything out the window and go back to basics with classic white. \n\nWhite is the most popular bathroom choice for a reason. Bathrooms tend to be among the smallest rooms in the house, so a light and bright canvas often makes the room feel bigger than it is. White also implies cleanliness and is often a calming shade, which is what you want when retreating to the space for some much-needed 'me time.'\n\nHere are 20 stunning modern white bathroom ideas that will inspire you to go back to basics in your home."

                        'Few things are as satisfying as standing in front of a house you’ve been involved in building, says Giuseppe Alvaro. “There is such a tangibility to it. First there’s the thrill of working out how you’re going to approach the task and then, when it’s done, being able to stand back and look at it with pride.”\n\nPride comes with the territory for Giuseppe who, as construction manager for Alvaro Bros, regularly works on some of Sydney’s most challenging and exciting architectural builds. \n\nGiuseppe’s father Domenico established Alvaro Bros after immigrating to Australia from Italy in the late 1960s. As a child, Giuseppe would spend part of his school holidays on building sites. “From the age of about nine I knew I wanted to work in construction,” he says. “I’ve always loved it. It’s in my blood.” \n\nAfter finishing school, Giuseppe obtained a degree in construction management from UTS, working on job sites at every opportunity. Today, aged 35, he is relishing being able to develop the family business alongside his sister Antonia, who brings engineering and commerce experience to the table. \n\nThe way things are done in the building industry is changing rapidly, says Giuseppe, and that’s not a bad thing. “We’re involved from the beginning of the process these days. Architects appreciate our input on constructability during the design stage, which helps smooth the process later.” \n\nA builder needs to be organised, have a clear picture of what the job involves and, of course, be personable. “It’s important to communicate well with homeowners, labourers, suppliers and architects – and that might involve approaching each one differently,” he says. \n\nAnother vital quality a builder requires is patience, says Giuseppe. “People want everything to be done quickly but I’m more interested in things being done efficiently. Sometimes you need to hold back the river of people who are rushing you. Things have to be done in the right sequence for the perfect result.” \n\nAustralian homeowners are fortunate because we have the best construction standards in the world, he says. “We also have the world’s best tradespeople, there’s no doubt about that.” \n\n**Alvaro Bros: [alvarobros.com.au](http://www.alvarobros.com.au/indexFlash.html|target="_blank")**'

This was followed by several years spent travelling the globe and stints in Los Angeles and Sydney before he settled in Adelaide in 1993 to set up his painting and decorating business. \n\n“Travelling the world and seeing different architecture and cultures has been the best inspiration,” he says. “It’s taught me that often it’s the most unusual and unexpected schemes that work the best, which has encouraged me to push the boundaries with colour.” \n\nHis interpretive skills are ones that he’s needed to call on more than once. “Often the client can’t pinpoint the look they’re after as it’s not something they’ve seen in the pages of a magazine – it might be a feeling they want to recreate or something they’ve seen on their travels. It’s my job to decipher their wishes and bring their dreams to life.” \n\nThe most challenging part of the job, he says, is when a client can’t make up their mind. “They’ll sometimes wake up in the middle of the night having thought up a whole new colour scheme. When that happens, my advice is always to stick with their first idea, as it’s generally the right one. \n\n“The beautiful thing about paint is that if you’re really not happy with it, you can change it fairly easily down the track.” \n\n**Jonathan Luby: [jonathanluby.com.au](http://www.jonathanluby.com.au/|target="_blank")**'

A particularly rewarding recent project was when he and his colleagues worked on a three-storey new build designed around top-of-the-line automation systems. \n\n“Everything from the home theatre to the air-conditioning, lighting and security system was automated and able to be remotely accessed,” he says of the award-winning project. “We worked closely with the client from the design phase through to handover, which was about 18 months, and we ironed out the issues that inevitably cropped up during the build.”'

It’s not just about knowing how to wire this stuff in, it’s about being able to advise your clients on it and to pass on your understanding to them,” says Chris. \n\nBut sometimes an electrician has to be able to call on other skills. “We occasionally get callouts to the home of an elderly person who insists their light isn’t working, only to discover they’ve been using the wrong switch. That’s when you need a bit of tact and empathy. Everyone’s human.” \n\nA good electrician stands or falls not only on the quality of his work, says Chris, but on the relationships he builds. “As is the case in any trade, you need to listen to a customer and deliver what they’re asking of you. It’s all about building trust. If someone trusts you, they’ll keep coming back.”  \n\n**PBE Insurelec: [pbeinsurelec.com](http://www.pbeinsurelec.com/|target="_blank")**'

And why not? It seems like a nice idea: you can wander out in the morning to check the weather; take in the view with a well earned cup of coffee/glass of wine; or relax out there with your laptop at the end of a long day. But the fact is I’ve never actually met anyone who does any of these things. Did we all imagine living someone else’s life? It’s like spa baths: nice idea, not activated.'

It’s popular because people think it looks neater, it makes the [TV](http://www.insideout.com.au/products/guides/buyers-guide-to-televisions) less obtrusive and there are no cables on view because they’re chased into the wall. But it can be complicated, hence expensive, and it’s pretty much permanent. Not for you if you like to upgrade your technology on a regular basis, or even if you like to change the room around every now and then. I’m predicting this one won’t last. Most TVs are designed to be watched at eye level so having your set sunk in above the [fireplace](http://www.insideout.com.au/search?sort_by=_score&filter%5Btype%5D%5Barticle%5D=1&filter%5Btype%5D%5Bcollection%5D=1&filter%5Btype%5D%5Bgallery%5D=1&q=fireplace) (a popular spot), even if you angle it, is literally a pain in the neck.'

Mirrors, mirrors, everywhere\n** Large [mirrors](http://www.insideout.com.au/products/guides/on-reflection-mirror-ideas-for-every-room-in-the-home) are popular because the wisdom is that they help make rooms feel larger. That’s why you often find them built in in [smaller spaces](http://www.insideout.com.au/products/guides/big-ideas-for-small-spaces). It’s true that they do bounce back the light and can make your room seem more airy and light-filled. But as with most things, there’s an overkill factor at play. I see lots of houses with floor to ceiling mirrors and once they’ve been put in it’s impossible to take them out without damaging the walls. And do you really want to be seeing yourself everywhere you look? My advice is if you want a big mirror, choose one in a frame that you can move more easily when you fancy a change.'

A couple of years earlier we had bought a lovely old house by the sea and thrown ourselves into renovating it. We’d ripped up carpets to uncover the timber floors, painted from top to bottom, and re-landscaped the yard. When Jo fell pregnant with Paige, we’d just overhauled our bedroom and bought a beautiful bed we had been saving up for and we wanted baby furniture to match. Jo searched every corner of the internet, but couldn’t find anything to our taste. Eventually, she asked me to make some. I roughed out a plan for the steel and wood components of the nappy change table, but wasn’t sure about what material I would use for the change top and basket. I suddenly hit upon the idea for the Danish cord while driving my kids home from daycare. It was a real ‘aha!’ moment."'

Also, I designed many elements of the weave, resulting in a pattern that’s quite different to what you would find in traditional Danish weaves. But mostly, I think the uniqueness lies in the manner in which the table and rocker push the long-maintained boundaries of nursery furniture design.'

When she finally got through to me, I actually just went really quiet — I think I was a bit in shock! Aside from the awesome prize, I was blown away by having my design validated by the Etsy Design Award judges, people like NGV senior curator Ewan McEoin, who apparently really loved it. I’d spent so many hours weaving that cord on, I’d lost all sight of whether it was even any good or not. So to have that validation was an incredible feeling, and gave me confidence to pursue furniture design more seriously.'

After being selected as a finalist for the [Fisher & Paykel](http://fisherpaykel.com.au|target="_blank") kitchen makeover competition, the couple prepared a moodboard for the judges: ’s editor-in-chief Claire Bradley, Darren Genner and Simona Castagna from [Minosa](http://minosadesign.com|target="_blank") and Frank Iaria of [Mint Kitchen Group](http://mintkitchengroup.com.au|target="_blank"). Janet and Wayne’s selection of textures and moody colours for their dream kitchen, plus their obvious passion for their cooking and entertaining zone impressed them all. “Janet was so passionate and enthusiastic about how the space could be transformed, I just couldn’t wait to see the outcome,” says Claire. Then it became all about turning the ideas into reality. “It was a real privilege working with Darren and Simona from Minosa and having their experience in what would work and what wouldn’t,” says Janet.'

The resulting unit is a “modern take on a buffet and hutch,” says Janet. The right side is designed for displays, and the door slides across to reveal an extra prep area and shelves. The final decisions on the design came from Janet’s original ideas, which the team at Minosa helped develop and shape. “The result is a bold statement that connects the living spaces,” she says. She and Wayne are thrilled with the results. “We’re just settling in. The rest of the house is what we’re going to focus on now,” says Janet.

And it’s important to note that ‘HEPA-like’ or ‘HEPA-type’ filters are not HEPA filters – check for the National Asthma Council Australia’s Sensitive Choice seal.\n The HEPA filter, however, is not the complete answer for those who are sensitive to dust. As Adam says, “Even the best vacuum can cause allergens to be distributed around a room. Many of these particles will settle, so if vacuuming causes respiratory issues, you should avoid the area for 20 minutes.”'

                        '**In the bag**\n A vacuum cleaner can be bagless, use a disposable paper dust collector or reusable cloth bags. Overall, bagless models are the easiest to empty, as the contents can be simply tipped into the bin. Disposable bags are thrown away when full but, if biodegradable, they can be added to the compost bin to give worms a tasty snack. The reusable options can be messy to empty, and the filters and dust containers must be kept clean.\n Steve Ramsey of Godfreys says that while many models include a nifty dustbag-full indicator, it’s still worth checking the bag before each use. “On most models, the bag needs to be changed when it’s about three-quarters full to ensure stronger suction,” he says.'
