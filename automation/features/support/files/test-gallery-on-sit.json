Walls sliced up the living spaces and the family had to zigzag through the house to catch water glimpses. \\n\\nThe challenge was to make the most of the views and introduce the spirit of the sea, yet reflect the home's place near the city. \\\"It had to feel calm and lived-in and more sophisticated than the traditional beach house,\\\" says Andrew.\"},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"label\":\"Paragraph\",\"content\":\"[Read the full article](http://www.homestolove.com.au/dreamy-modern-beach-house-in-sydney-2091/|target=\\\"_blank\\\")\\n\\nArticle from: *Australian House & Garden*\\nText: Chris Pearson\\nPhotos: Nicholas Watt\"}]",
